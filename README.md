# Writing Samples
I have over 10 years of combined writing experience in journalism, education, and technical writing. Some of my earlier technical writing experience was through a state job with Disability Determinations, and I currently work full time as a technical writer/documentation specialist at a large financial institution. Most of my current technical writing has been on internal procedures that I cannot share in a portfolio, so I've included links to other writing samples below.
## Technical and Business Writing
- [Submitting Poetry Responses to Teams (PDF)](https://github.com/LAS3113/writing-samples/files/7068614/Gregory_writingsample1.pdf) - (Downloads as PDF) A brief "how-to" document to help students navigate the Class Notebook in Microsoft Teams, which I utilized during distance education. 
- [Dress Code One-Page Sample (PDF)](https://github.com/LAS3113/writing-samples/blob/main/Gregory_writingsample2.pdf) - (Opens in new window) A writing sample as part of a previous hiring process. I was given a short prompt and asked to design a one-page document for hypothetical employees.

I created the following documents as part of a graduate-level document design class.
