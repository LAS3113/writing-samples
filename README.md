# Writing Samples
My writing experience includes journalism, education, and technical writing. Some of my technical writing experience was through a state job with Disability Determinations, and I am not able to provide samples from that time period because the information is confidential. I've included links to other writing samples below.
## Business Writing
I created the following documents as part of a graduate-level document design class.
