# Writing Samples
I have years of writing experience in journalism, education, and technical writing. Some of my earlier technical writing experience was through a state job with Disability Determinations, and I currently work full time as a technical writer/documentation specialist at a large financial institution. Most of my technical writing has been on internal procedures that I cannot share in a portfolio, so I've included links to other writing samples below.
## Technical and Business Writing

I created the following documents as part of a graduate-level document design class.
