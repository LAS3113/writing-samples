# Writing Samples
My writing experience includes journalims, education, and technical writing. Some of my technical writing experience was through a state job with Disability Determinations, and I am not able to provide samples from that time period because the information is confidential. I've included links to other writing samples below.
- [Submitting Poetry Responses to Teams (PDF)](https://github.com/LAS3113/writing-samples/files/7068614/Gregory_writingsample1.pdf) - A brief "how-to" document to help students navigate the Class Notebook in Microsoft Teams, which I utilized during distance education in early 2020. 
- [Teaching Portfolio (PDF)](https://github.com/LAS3113/writing-samples/files/7004760/LaurenBegleyTeachingPortfolio.pdf) - This document includes a sample syllabus and assignment guidelines.
